## Send Historical Order Data to Klaviyo

The following feature can be found in the Craft admin panel under Utilities -> Klaviyo Connect.

Sends historical order data to Klaviyo for a given date range. Useful if you installed the plugin after your store has already had customers, or you start a new Klaviyo account. Select one of the following in the date picker:

* All - **Doesn't actually send all (or any) orders -- this is here because the date picker used is the default Craft date picker**. Some stores have a lot of historical order data, so we didn't want "All" to be a true default. This is to prevent accidentally sending all orders to Klaviyo. Use a custom date range if you actually want to send all orders.
* Today
* This week - Only orders from the current week (see "Past 7 days" for orders up to one week ago)
* This month - Only orders from the current month (see "Past 30 days" for orders up to one month ago)
* This year - Only orders from the current year (see "Past year" for orders up to one year ago)
* Past 7 days
* Past 30 days
* Past 90 days
* Past year
* From/To - Allows you to enter a custom date range
